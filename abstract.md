<h1>Abstract</h1>
Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) combine the CPU and GPU capabilities onto a single piece of silicon, making their popularity grow within the high-performance computing field. With the release of AMD’s new APU under the MI300x architecture and the development of the next fastest supercomputer, El Capitan at Lawrence-Livermore National Lab, utilizing the MI300x APUs, we need to create monitoring tools to ensure we are optimizing the performance of our APU resources. AMD’s ROCProfiler provides performance monitoring capability for AMD GPUs and APUs. The Light-Weight Distributed Metric System (LDMS) at Sandia is a widely utilized infrastructure that offers application monitoring capabilities for large-scale systems. Given that Sandia has already implemented CPU application monitoring using LDMS, we decided to extend this capability to include monitoring for AMD GPUs and APUs. In this report, we examine the current limitations of AMD's ROCProfiler monitoring tool, describe our approach to addressing these challenges, and provide an overview of capabilities of the tool we developed to monitor GPU performance within LDMS. By focusing on the MI250x accelerator GPUs that we have access to at Sandia we developed a proof-of-concept prototype aimed to be implemented on the current fastest supercomputer, Frontier at Oakridge National Lab, to eventually be adapted for the MI300x APUs on El Capitan. Our tool provides performance counter results during runtime as a time series with trivial decrease in performance. This allows the user to examine the progress of application performance throughout the systems lifetime.
